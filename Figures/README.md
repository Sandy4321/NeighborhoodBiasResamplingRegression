## Figures 

This folder includes all the figures presented in the paper. They are organized into:

- **Global**; and
- **WicoxonTest**


The folder **Global** includes the figures with the results concerning the median values of the $F_1^{\phi}$ metric considered in the paper. The folder **WilcoxonTest** contains all the figures produced with the results of the paired comparison between the resampling strategies and the baseline under consideration (either no sampling, random under-sampling or smoteR).
